- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Heejung-Hillary-Choi.

- - I LUV my Koean name, but still, I understand mates around the world cannot read my name correctly. SO I got my English name, Hillary. 
- - No, I don't admire Hillary Clinton, but, I usually mention her name when I introduce myself to others so that people-even a perfect stranger haahaha- can remember my name more easilyğŸ’™  

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Traveling and Developing new projects...
- - I've been in Japan, Taiwan, China, Philippines, and Austraila.
- - I had lived in Sydney and Melbourne, AU... That was one of the loveliest times in my days.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mostly Java and Oracle DB...
- - I am still a newcommer in this world. I feel like I'm gettin whole new info every minute..
