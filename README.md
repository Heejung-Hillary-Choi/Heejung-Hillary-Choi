- - I've been in Japan, Taiwan, China, Philippines, and Austraila.
- - I had lived in Sydney and Melbourne, AU... That was one of the loveliest times in my days.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mostly Java and Oracle DB...
- - I am still a newcommer in this world. I feel like I'm gettin whole new info every minute..
